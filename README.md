# ProfessionalTennisAnalysis
This is a personal project to analyze the impact of various types of shots in tennis (ex. aces) on predicting  the outcome of a tennis match.

Disclaimer: The raw professional datasets on the professional tennis matches I used in this analysis are created by Jeff Sackman. You can view his Github profile here: https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp
